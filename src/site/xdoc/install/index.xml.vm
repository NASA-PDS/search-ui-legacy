    <section name="System Requirements">
      <p>This section details the system requirements for installing and operating the Search User Interface.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Java Runtime Environment">
        <p>The Search User Interface was developed using Java and will run on any platform with a supported Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The software was specifically compiled for and tested under Java version 1.8. The following commands test the local Java installation in a UNIX-based environment:
        </p>

        <source>
% which java
/usr/bin/java

% java -version
java version "1.8.0_101"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_101-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode)
        </source>

        <p>The first command above checks whether the <i>java</i> executable is in the environment's path and the second command reports the version. If Java is not installed or the version is not at least 1.7, Java will need to be downloaded and installed in the current environment. Consult the local system administrator for installation of this software. For the do-it-yourself crowd, the Java software can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/" target="_blank">Oracle Java Download</a> page. The suggested software package is the Java Standard Edition (SE) 8, either the JDK or the JRE package. The JDK package is not necessary to run the software but could be useful if development and compilation of Java software will also occur in the current environment.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Java Application Server">
        <p>The Search User Interface requires a Java application server for hosting the web application. The suggested application server for this release is Apache Tomcat with a minimal version of 7.0.X. Consult the local system administrator for installation of this software. For the do-it-yourself crowd, see the <a href="../../../release/index-tomcat.html" target="_blank">Tomcat Deployment</a> document for installation and configuration details. If viewing this document from the ${project.artifactId} package, view the <a href="http://pds-engineering.jpl.nasa.gov/development/pds4/current/release/index-tomcat.html" target="_blank">Tomcat Deployment</a> document from the Engineering Node site.
        </p>

        <p>The top-level directory where Apache Tomcat is installed (i.e. the directory containing the <i>webapps</i> and <i>conf</i> sub-directories) will be referenced in these instructions as $TOMCAT_HOME.
        </p>
      </subsection>
    </section>

    <section name="Unpacking the Package">
      <p>Download the <i>${project.artifactId}</i> package from the PDS <a href="ftp://pds.nasa.gov/pub/toplevel/2010/search/" target="_blank">FTP</a> site. The binary distribution is available in identical zip or tar/gzip packages. The installation directory may vary from environment to environment but in UNIX-based environments it is typical to install software packages in the <i>/usr/local</i> directory and in Windows-based environments it is typical to install software packages in the <i>C:\Program Files</i> directory. Unpack the selected binary distribution file with one of the following commands:
      </p>

      <source>
% unzip ${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-bin.zip
or
% tar -xzvf ${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-bin.tar.gz
      </source>

      <p>Note: Depending on the platform, the native version of <i>tar</i> may produce an error when attempting to unpack the distribution file because many of the file paths are greater than 100 characters. If available, the GNU version of tar will resolve this problem. If that is not available or cannot be installed, the zipped package will work just fine in a UNIX environment.
      </p>

      <p>The commands above result in the creation of the <i>${project.artifactId}-${project.version}</i> directory with the following directory structure:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>README.txt</b><br/>
          <p>A README file directing the user to the available documentation for the project.

    <section name="Deploying the Application">
      <p>The Search User Interface web application is packaged as a WAR file and is intended for installation under a standard Java Application Server. There are two options for deploying the WAR file:
      </p>

      <subsection name="Copy WAR To webapps directory">
        <ol>
          <li>Locate the WAR file (${project.artifactId}.war) in the Search UI package.</li>
          <li>Copy this file to the <i>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps</i> directory.</li>
          <li>Create an XML context file, <i>$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/${project.artifactId}.xml</i> containing the following:
            <source>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Context crossContext="true"&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;
            </source>
          </li>
          <li>Restart Tomcat.</li>
        </ol>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Create Context File To Point To WAR">
        <p>Assuming Search UI WAR and accompanying directories are located at <i>/usr/local/${project.artifactId}</i> (if not, substitute the directory location as needed), we need to set the application to allow for cross-context so it can use the various server-side includes.  We can do this by creating <i>$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/${project.artifactId}.xml</i> containing the following text:
        </p>

        <source>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Context docBase="/usr/local/${project.artifactId}/${project.artifactId}.war" crossContext="true"&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;
        </source>
      </subsection>
    </section>

    <section name="Deploying the Extras">
      <p>The Search User Interface also depends on several other directories from the PDS Website that include images, Javascript, CSS, and server-side include files that are in the <i>extras</i> directory in Search UI package (i.e. /usr/local/${project.artifactId}/extras).  This contains the following directories:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>css</li>
        <li>images</li>
        <li>include</li>
        <li>js</li>
        <li>scripts</li>
      </ul>

      <subsection name="PDS Engineering Deployment">
  <p>The current Search UI is intended for deployment on both the PDS Engineering website, as well as external users.  The remaining installation procedures can be ignored for PDS EN deployment because these directories are already included in the PDS EN website.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="All Other Deployments">
        <p>If the directories above are not in the <i>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps</i> directory already, create the following Tomcat context files in <i>$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost</i> to include these directories:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>css.xml
            <source>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Context docBase="/usr/local/${project.artifactId}/extras/css" &gt;&lt;/Context&gt;
            </source>
          </li>
          <li>images.xml
            <source>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Context docBase="/usr/local/${project.artifactId}/extras/images" &gt;&lt;/Context&gt;
            </source>
          </li>
          <li>include.xml
            <source>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Context docBase="/usr/local/${project.artifactId}/extras/include" &gt;&lt;/Context&gt;
            </source>
          </li>
          <li>js.xml
            <source>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Context docBase="/usr/local/${project.artifactId}/extras/js" &gt;&lt;/Context&gt;
            </source>
          </li>
          <li>scripts.xml
            <source>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Context docBase="/usr/local/${project.artifactId}/extras/scripts" &gt;&lt;/Context&gt;
            </source>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>An alternative solution is to move all of the directories into the $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory: (assumes Search UI software and directories are at /usr/local/${project.artifactId})
        </p>
        <p><b>Unix Environment</b></p>

        <source>
$ mv extras/* $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps
        </source>

        <p>Restart Tomcat to ensure the changes take effect.</p>
